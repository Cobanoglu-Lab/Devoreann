A Deep Learning Development Environment in Virtual Reality
Virtual reality (VR) offers immersive visualization and intuitive interaction. We leverage VR to enable any biomedical professional to deploy a deep learning (DL) model for image classification. While DL models can be powerful tools for data analysis,they are also challenging to understand and develop. To make deep learning more accessible and intuitive, we have built a virtual reality-based DL development environment. Within our environment, the user can move tangible objects to construct a neural networkonly using their hands. Our software automatically translates these configurations into a trainable model and then reports its resultingaccuracy on a test dataset in real-time. Furthermore, we have enriched the virtual objects with visualizations of the modelâ€™scomponents such that users can achieve insight about the DL models that they are developing. With this approach, we bridge the gapbetween professionals in different fields of expertise while offering a novel perspective for model analysis and data interaction. We further suggest that techniques of development and visualization in deep learning can benefit by integrating virtual reality.
